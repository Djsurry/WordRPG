1) Add Quest for player.

2) Add logic so the game knows if the player is in a town so you have 
    a new option appear in screen with your movment that ask you if you 
    want to go to the store to buy, food, potions, weapons, armor, other
    stuff.

3) More Animals

4) Add a type of mob that will steal your weapon from you.

5) Add potions and maybe even brewing so there will be items for brewing.

6) Not sure how yet but I would kill to make a random map every time.

7) Help screen

8) Way to inspeact stuff in the area you are in

9) A way to check stats of player or object in inventory

10) Save and Load

11) Maybe add Music

12) 

For now that is all I can think of but I will add more as I go.
