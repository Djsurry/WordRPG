1) Add Quest for player.

2) Add logic so the game knows if the player is in a town so you have 
    a new option appear in screen with your movment that ask you if you 
    want to go to the store to buy, food, potions, weapons, armor, other
    stuff.

3) More Animals

4) Add a way to change the gender in the store to suit the player

For now that is all I can think of but I will add more as I go.
