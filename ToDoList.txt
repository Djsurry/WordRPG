If you start a project please say so in discord and also update this file and place you name and under it what\
you are working on.
I'm new like you and haven't got a clue what I'm doing. Saying that I do know we need to work clean and comment
on everything! There is no such thing is to many comments.  We need to communicate on this project a lot to make
sure we dont mess up each other. This is my first project with other so im all ears. if you have any ideas let
me know.

Things to do:


    1) The help() menu needs to be made.

        Function of it:

            The Help Menu needs to guide the player in any and every part of the game to how the combat works
            to how movement works. Pretty much anything in the game needs to be explained.
            I think the help() screen or some for of help function should be in the game at all times even
            if you are just roaming around the world and you type help.


Notes:
    Feel free to add anything you want to add.
