# About This Project
I have Lot's of plans for this game but it is a labor of love so I may get board at some point and quit, but that isn't the case as of yet. In the game you can choose to be a Mage, Warrior, Archer or an Assassin. There will be weapons spisivic to a playing class and also weapons that two or all classes can use. The player will be able to level up and sell/buy item from NPC.

# In the Future
I think I would like to port this project over to pygame once its well established so it may be a 2d game at some point.
Also depends if im doing it alone or with some one. If I'm working on this project still and im by my self I'll try and make it in C# and Unity. I've never made a full program with C# nor have I made anything in unity so who knows.
