Text based RPG game with a story, shopping, NPC's, and fighing

I have Lot's of plans for this game but it is a labor of love so I may get board at some point and quit, but that isn't the case as of yet.

In the game you can choose to be a Mage, Warrior, Archer or an Assassin. There will be weapons spisivic to a playing class and also weapons that two or all classes can use. The player will be able to level up and sell/buy item from NPC.

I think I would like to port this project over to pygame once its well established so it may be a 3d game at some point.

If you are playing the game feel free to message me on discord https://discord.gg/NFKuBq about bugs or ideas!

Also if you want to help out on the project and have ideas hit me up and show me some code!
